For this project, I utilized PostgreSQL as the primary database system. Initially, I established a database named "employee_db," comprising six tables: "departments" (9 rows, 2 columns), "department_employee" (331,603 rows, 4 columns), "department_manager" (24 rows, 4 columns), "employee" (300,024 rows, 6 columns), "salary" (1,141,783 rows, 4 columns), and "title" (443,308 rows, 4 columns).

Subsequently, I established a connection between the PostgreSQL database and Python within the Jupyter Notebook environment. Leveraging this connection, I executed queries, presenting their outcomes through graphical representations to enhance comprehension.

The addressed queries encompassed the following inquiries:

Find counts of each and every table.
Which department has the highest average salary of active employees ? Give some plots to show the avg salary department-wise.
Which title has the highest avg salary? Give some plots to show the avg salary title-wise.
Distribution of salary across titles.
Distribution of salary across departments.
How many active managers in each department. Is there any department with no manager?
Composition of titles department-wise. Appropriate plots.
Composition of departments title-wise. Appropriate plots.
Salaries of active department managers. Which department's manager who is active earns the most?
What are the titles of active department managers? Are they managers only?
